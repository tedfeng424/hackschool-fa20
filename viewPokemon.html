        <h2>Mimikyu</h2>
        <img src="https://i.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/001/370/551/3f4.gif"></img>
        <p>Mimikyu lives its life completely covered by its cloth and is always hidden. People believe 
            that anybody who sees its true form beneath the cloth will be stricken with a mysterious illness. 
            People in the Alola region are convinced that you must never try to peek beneath its covering. 
            Mimikyu's health fails when it’s bathed in the rays of the sun, so it prefers to stick to dark places. 
            It’s rumored that the reason it covers itself with a cloth is to avoid sunlight.</p>

        <h2>Darkrai</h2>
